# clockWithButtons

A small project to help me get a better understanding on Microcontrollers and most of all timers and interrupts. I am using a SMA420564 4 digit 7+1 segment display driven by an Arduino Mega 2560 R3 board with an ATmega2560 microprocessor. Also some noname buttons that came with my DIY kit. I am also using several libraries i found online, they are not my work.



(will add more info, maybe even documentations and schematics later)
